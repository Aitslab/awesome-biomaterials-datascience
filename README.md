# Awesome Data Science Resources for Biomaterials Research [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
databases, datasets, software, models and other datascience resources for studying biomaterials

>A biomaterial is a substance that has been engineered to interact with biological systems for a medical purpose â€“ 
>either a therapeutic (treat, augment, repair, or replace a tissue function of the body) or a diagnostic one.
